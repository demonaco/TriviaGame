# TriviaGame

## Techbologies used:
Visual Studio Code, jQuery library, Google fonts, giphy.com.

## Summary: The purpose of this assignment was to test drive the more immediate skills we've learned with jQuery. I had a lot of fun with this assignment and I learned a lot just working through it. jQuery selectors were used to add methods to change html elements. I was able to get most features in place other than scorekeeping, which I tried many different methods to accomplish.

## Steps:

1. I started by choosing a background image and through CSS placed it on the page.
2. Applied div to introduce the game along with an included start button.
3. Made a container div for the question set.
4. Looked up Star Wars trivia and used the questions from research/set up radio input buttons.
5. worked on jQuery to get the quiz to start using a .click method
6. Youtube'd solutions for how to implement a time countdown
7. tried applying a variety of ways for score keeping including correct++ and using .html to display the counter increase after correct answers were selected.

## I look forward to hearing feedback on this assignment! So far, this has been my favorite one by a long-shot. The amount I've learned from just the crystals game last week has been considerable. Enjoy some Star Wars trivia!
